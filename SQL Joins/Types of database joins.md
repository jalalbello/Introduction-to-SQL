In a left join the data on the left will always be on the result set, while the data on the right only if it has any matching records

## Anti Join

## Full Outer Join

Return all records regardless of matches

## Cross Join

Instead of Joining on a common collumn and finding matching records, it will create a cartesian product, using all records in each table
